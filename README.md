Figma to HTML projects
## What is This Project?
This project is a way for me to test my vanilla html, css and javascript capabilities and showcase my skills.
## Plan
- host project live on github
- each site created will linked on the hosted page so people can preview the different sites
- maybe upload the figma links so people can compare the sites to their mockups
